In order to build on Tezos you need to understand a lot of distinct technologies, languages, frameworks, and all with very minimal documentation written by developers who know Tezos for developers who know Tezos.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## My goal for this project:\\n\\n1. Simple docs for simple frictionless development on Tezos\\n2. Create a one stop shop with robust documentation of useful tools\\n3. Make this a community effort and show the importance of creating good documentation\\n4. Create and inspire best practices for dev docs across the ecosystem\\n5.
