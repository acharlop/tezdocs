## Tezos dev docs done right.

While the [Tezos](https://tezos.com) ecosystem continues to grow theres still a massive barrier to entry that I see. In order to build on Tezos you need to understand a lot of distinct technologies, languages, frameworks, and all with very minimal documentation written by developers who know Tezos for developers who know Tezos.

<!--truncate-->

## My goal for this project:

1. Simple docs for simple frictionless development on Tezos
2. Create a one stop shop with robust documentation of useful tools
3. Make this a community effort and show the importance of creating good documentation
4. Create and inspire best practices for dev docs across the ecosystem
5. Evaluate all tools and pick based the right tool for the job

## Note

**Until the project has reached stability all pages are subject to being changed.**
